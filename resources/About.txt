<h2>How To Play:</h2>

<h3>Single Player:</h3>
<p>
Pick a disease and a name and try to wipe out the world's population! Over time you will get points that will allow you to buy perks and increase the various stats
of your disease. Be careful: as you kill people and get noticed, humanity will start working on a cure to destroy you.  You must be careful in order to infect the whole world 
before you are noticed and it is too late. You can adjust the speed of the game or pause if you like. You can also save the game and continue later.
</p>

<h3>Multiplayer:</h3>
<p>
You don't have to kill everyone in the entire world: just more people than your opponents. The winner is whoever gets the most kills before either everyone in the world is dead 
or all diseases have no one infected.
