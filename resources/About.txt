<h2>How To Play:</h2>

<h3>Single Player:</h3>
<p>
Pick a disease and a name and try to wipe out the world's population! Over time you will get points that will allow you to buy perks and increase the various stats
of your disease. Be careful: as you kill people and get noticed, humanity will start working on a cure to destroy you.  You must be careful in order to infect the whole world 
before you are noticed and it is too late. You can adjust the speed of the game or pause if you like. You can also save the game and continue later.
</p>

<h3>Multiplayer:</h3>
<p>
You don't have to kill everyone in the entire world: just more people than your opponents. The winner is whoever gets the most kills before either everyone in the world is dead 
or all diseases have no one infected.

Disease Types:

Virus: Viruses are deadly because of their ability to evolve quickly. They
achieve random mutation at much higher rate than other diseases, and start off
virulent. Their draw backs are that they start off visible, and they must pay 
money to sell their perks. This makes it so that - though you may get a good
perk randomly - if you get a bad perk, you have to pay to get rid of it!

Parasite: Parasites start off silent, but deadly. Their benefit is in their
ability to gain lethality and infectivity over time, and sell their perks to
get money back. They do not acquire random perks except very, very rarely.

Bacteria: Bacteria straddle the two above. It is reasonably visible, deadly
and infectious. They acquire random perks relatively rarely, and can sell
their unwanted perks for money.

All three have different sets of perks, from the Bacteria's super deadly 'Organ
failure' and Parasite's 'Stomach Ulcers'. Choose wisely!
